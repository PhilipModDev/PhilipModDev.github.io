        is a small Minecraft Mod developer/programmer who
        likes to make awesome content, like Philip's ruins or
        Philip's weapons, these mods are very well-made, and they are all
        programed in Java/ <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/">
        The Forge Frame Work.</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        The Forge Frame Work is a Java class library
        for Minecraft Bedrock as well as For Minecraft Java.
        Though Forge, it is possible to make Minecraft mods as
        well as fabric mods.

        <a href="https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/latest/gettingstarted/">Getting Started with Forge Here.
        </a>

         Forge is not also a Frame work, but it's a mod loader. For example,
         when Minecraft code database is complied, it turns into byte code.
         So what this means is that when forge loads a mod work space, it
         has to decompile the code, so we can read it. Most forge workspace
         runs on grade, or maven build tools.
    </p>

       The <a href="https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/">fabric loader</a>  
       dose the same of what forge dose, but it's more  on the performance 
       and uses less system resources. This is why fabric is a great choice for modding.

        One of the most popular mods made by PhilipModDev is 
        <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ruins"> Philip's ruins</a>
        . It aims to improve the aspect of exploration by simply adding ruins. These ruins
        can be all different sizes as well being underground and in other dimensions of 
        the game. The mod not just includes ruins, but custom blocks as well. These blocks
        that the mod includes normaly spawns with the dungeons that spawns in. The list 
        given below shows some of the blocks added.
        grim stone Bricks.
        <li>Bone bricks/slabs/stairs.</li>
        <li>Cracked Bone bricks.</li>
        <li>Obsidian bricks.</li>
        <li>Soul bricks</li>
        <li>grim stone Bricks.</li>
        Another exciting fact about the new structures is that they are all on a spawning tier based. For example, say that
        you found one of are ruins and it looks small, and it has no chest included, well you just found a level one ruin. But lets
        say that you found another ruin with a chest included. You open the chest, and it is name is level two ruin's loot. Well 
        that is indicating that you found a level two ruin.
         Here is another feature that is mod comes with (Randomized Loot Table System). Each ruin you come across that has
        a chest and it will be randomized. The loot is based off on the ruin's tier level. Like for example a lower-level ruin will be low
        level loot, but the more you find a higher-level ruin as well as it being harder to find, it well includes a better reward.
        <li>Mod downloads: 500,000</li>

       Here is another mod made by PhilipModDev,<a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/philips-mob-events1-19-2-1-0">Philip's Mob Events.</a>  This mod makes improvements to mobs in Minecraft.
       It focus on improving the mobs difficulty as well as the game in generial. Well, you may be wondering what types 
       of events? Well in this case we are talking about miniboss events,
       as well as mob perks. These events are basically random of when it can occur. 
       So, make sure you are prepared to fight, or have a strong base of self-defense.
